IELTS Rubric: IELTS Writing Band Descriptors
The IELTS Writing rubric evaluates four different aspects of your responses: 
Coherence and Cohesion, Lexical Resource, Grammatical Range and Accuracy, and Task Achievement (or Task Response, for Task 2).
The IELTS independent writing task also requires you to write an essay on a given topic. The essay should be about 250 words. 
Essay is graded on a scale of 0 to 9 points, with 9 being the highest score.
